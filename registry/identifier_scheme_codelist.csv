XM-DAC,"The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) maintain a list of organisations whom are involved in the transfer of 'Official Development Assistance' (ODA) financial flows. This list provides a useful fall-back source of identification for government agencies and multilateral organisations involved in aid, and in some cases, for international NGOs. 

The list is updated perioidically in response to demand for new entries from DAC members. 

Users should note that this list is designed to identify both organisations *and* funds or programmes, and so not all entries in this list equate to legally registered organisations. 

The list is available as a spreadsheet containing multiple codelists. Two can be used to construct organisation identifiers.

* The **Agency** list is used to construct identifiers for aid donor and recipient government agencies. This is constructed by combining the **donorcode** and **AgencyCode**, separated with a dash. For example, XM-DAC-1-8 identifies the Austrian (1) Development Agency (8).
 
* The **Channel codes** list is used to construct identifiers for multilateral organisations, and international NGOs for whom no other identifier is available. The 'Channel ID' should be used. For example, XM-DAC-41301 is the identifier for the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). 

* The **Donor** list contains donor code values referring to the donor country as a whole. To maximise consistency, donor codes should not be used unless a specific agency, government department or fund is not identified for the reporting. In all other cases codes should be published in their 'Agency' form (e.g. XM-DAC-1-8 for Austrian Development Agency, rather than XM-DAC-1). 

Users should also note that some organisations exist in both the 'Channel Codes' and 'Agency' lists. As the Channel Codes list provides a cross-walk, use of the Channel Codes is preferred in these cases.",,True,"963-1, 1-8, 41301","Users can download an Excel file of the DAC and CRS codes from the OECD website.

If you are searching for a multilateral organisation or international NGO, search the 'Channel codes' list. If you find the organisation you are looking for, use the value of the 'Channel ID' column.

If you are searching for government agency, search the 'Agency' list, and when you find the row you want, combine the 'donorcode' and 'AgencyCode' columns, separated by '-'.

""The IFU's main objective is:

* Consolidate and secure information about any identified person;
* To establish a reliable database for information, cross-checking and management purposes;
* Improve and modernize the management of public finances with the introduction of a development tax system;""[1]

Identifiers are assigned to: ""

* Enterprises engaged in commercial or non-commercial activity in the territory of Benin, regardless of their form, legal status or nationality;
* Employees in the public or private sector;
* Corporate officers;
* Embassies, international organizations and non-governmental organizations;
* Landowners;
* Individuals over eighteen (18) years of age engaged in self-employed or non-commercial activities;
* Central government, public institutions and local authorities;
* Trade unions and political parties, any natural or legal person governed by private law""[1].

An IFU is 13 characters long. The first digit indicate the type of entity identified:

* 1- Individual / male 
* 2- Individual / female 
* 3- Legal entity / company 
* 4- Legal person / state structure 
* 5- Legal person / international organization and mission diplomatic 
* 6- Legal person / non-governmental organization

The subsequent 4 digits give the year. 

The next six digits are a unique identifier within that year.

The next digit indicates either (1) a parent company; (2-9) subsidiary or agencies; (0) other types of person or taxpayer.

The final digit is a checksum.

XI-BRIDGE,"Led by three nonprofit partners – Foundation Center, GlobalGiving, and GuideStar – BRIDGE assigns a unique identification number, known as a BRIDGE number, to individual social sector entities around the world. Each 10-digit BRIDGE number is randomly generated and unique to an organization.

**The country or countries that the list covers**: BRIDGE is global in scope. To date, BRIDGE numbers for organizations/entities in eight countries have been released as open data: Australia, Canada, Ireland, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and United States. Data for additional countries will be released on an ongoing basis as the BRIDGE team assesses and addresses any potential data privacy and security risks of making this data publicly available.

**The legal form or organizations that the list covers**: BRIDGE covers a variety of entities. Any private organization or program anywhere in the world devoted to social good can be assigned a BRIDGE number. The social sector encompasses the entire ecosystem of institutions that work to advance social good, regardless of organization type. This includes foundations, nonprofit organizations, schools, religious organizations, and companies. In addition, BRIDGE may assign numbers to individual chapters or branches of an organization, to programs (such as corporate giving programs), as well as to funds, which often essentially function as independent organizations. A BRIDGE number can be assigned to any entity, whether active or inactive, valid or fraudulent, new or old. A BRIDGE number itself conveys no information about the validity, veracity, quality, or status of an organization, including its current existence as a viable entity. It only serves to disambiguate and uniquely define records. BRIDGE does not assign numbers to individuals.

Organisations registering with Rwanda Governance Board are issued a temporary operational certificate of registration, valid for a period 12 months, and must apply for legal personality within 9 months from the issue of the temporary certificate [2].

Decisions to grant legal personality to national non-governmental organisations are published in the [Official Gazette of the Republic of Rwanda](http://primature.gov.rw/media-publication/publication/latest-offical-gazettes.html). [2]

This information is maintained by Infogreffe. Infogreffe provide a basic overview of company information for free, and bulk download of data for a fee.

A note on identifiers: 

- A SIRET number is constituted by the SIREN number, plus the NIC code. 

- The SIREN number relates to a business, whereas a SIRET number relates to a specific geographically located establishment which will be owned by a business.

- ""A SIREN number is your unique French business identification number. This 9 digit number will be requested by all French administration when dealing with you.. It is a proof that you are a fully registered French business"" [1]

""The SIRET code/number is an INSEE code which allows the geographic identification of any French establishment or business.

The 14-digit number consists of three parts:

- first, the SIREN code of the business (or legal unit or person) that owns the unit represented by the SIRET code,
- second, the NIC (French: Numéro interne de classement), is a sequential four-digit number unique to the establishment,
- and finally, a check digit that verifies the entire SIRET number.

For example, 732 829 320 00074 would refer to the seventh establishment of the business with SIREN number 732 829 320."" [2]

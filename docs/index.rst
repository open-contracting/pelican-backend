Pelican backend
===============

.. include:: ../README.rst

Word choice
-----------

To avoid ambiguity:

- "collection" refers to the collection in Kingfisher Process, and "dataset" refers to the imported collection in Pelican backend.
- "compiled release" refers to the ``data`` value of the compiled release in Kingfisher Process, and "item" refers to its corresponding row in the ``data_item`` table in Pelican backend.

In the code and database, "resource" is used for "compiled release" (or "item"), and "time variance" is used for "time-based". In the documentation, we use the latter words to be consistent with the user interface and with other tools.
